> [!IMPORTANT]
> Undocs is currently intended for UnJS docs only and is not fully customizable yet. <br>
> Contributions are more than welcome but please consider that this project is not ready yet to be used. <br>
> Make sure to use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for Windows.
> We don't guarantee stability yet and it is expected that it doesn't work time to time.
