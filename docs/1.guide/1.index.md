## Overview

UnJS Docs is a minimal Documentation Theme and CLI for shared usage across UnJS projects.

It is made with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com), and [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro) with a zero config and elegant CLI wrapper.

## Quick Start

Create `docs/` project with starter template:

:pm-x{command="giget gh:unjs/undocs/template docs --install"}

Go to the docs dir `cd docs/`

Start development server:

:pm-run{script="dev"}

Build for production:

:pm-run{script="build"}
